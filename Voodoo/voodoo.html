            <p>We started the initial prototyping on wokwi.com. Our goal was to create a cicuit with 9 leds and pair them with arudino and MPU6050.
                We soon realised that using traditional leds was too much of hassle in terms of wiring and coding. <br><br>
                So we choose <strong> NeoPixles </strong>for this project which made our wiring and code more efficient.

            To tackle this problem, we created <strong>fixed, force sensor</strong>  trigger inspired from fixed control stick of F-22 Raptor.

               One of the question when we thought about motion control was what will happen when we drop the controller by mistake. This led to realization of
              the need for a fail safe mechanism. <br><br>

               We installed a switch between trigger and force sensor. This button is <strong>needs to be pressed</strong> to control the plane.
                This switch also acts as <strong>reset of the controller's zero position</strong> because after long flights the zero position ususally drift away
